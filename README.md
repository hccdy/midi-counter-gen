# Midi Counter Generator
If you want to generate a counter for a MIDI, you will have 3 choices:
1. Use Keppy's Counter Generator. Most people uses this for a smaller MIDI, but it will load the whole MIDI into RAM and it's not good for those old computers.
2. Use Zenith. Zenith is a better choice because it won't load the whole MIDI into RAM so it's good for those old computers, but for some MIDIs, its speed is so slow. If you are making a video and you want to have a counter, you don't want to take lots of time on it. If your MIDI is in a zipped file and can't be extracted (the file size after extracting will be too large for your hard disk), then you can't use Zenith because it doesn't suppoert zipped files.
3. Use **CJC's Midi Counter Generator**. This is the best choice because it won't load the whole MIDI but it's as fast as Keppy's Counter Generator, and it supports zipped files! The largest MIDI's counter it generated contains 54 trillion notes and the extracted file size will be 150TB!
